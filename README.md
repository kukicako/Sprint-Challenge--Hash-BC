# Sprint Challenge: Hash Tables and Blockchain

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint, we learned how hash tables combine two data structures to get the best of both worlds and were introduced into the fascinating world of blockchains. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by solving algorithms in Python using hash tables and add another key feature to your blockchain.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Python and your command of the concepts and techniques in related to hash tables and blockchains.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts:  Hash tables coding, blockchain coding, and a short interview covering parts of hash tables and blockchain.

## Interview Questions

Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
    -- dynamic arrows grow when you insert (x2 in most cases). Static array already has predetermined length/storage so it size cant be altered

* What is the runtime complexity to access an array
    -- O(1)

, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?
    --usually it is O(1) since  you dont have to shift indices. but if you add an item it can also be O(n) if the array has run outta storage.

* What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?
    -- you add an item making it o(n) so then it has to copy all the        items from the first array into the new one.

Explain how a blockchain is structured.
    --data structure that keeps public ledger of transactions but even tho it is public the cryptography keeps it secure. used for crpytocurrency.

What are the blocks,
    -- block is file where data is permenantly stored
        contains index number/timestamp/transactions/proof/prev-hash
 
what is the chain? 
    -- stores the hash data of the prev block creating a long chain. If     you tried to change one of them to give yourself an advantage then it would change all of them
  
How is the data organized?
    -- first block (genisis block) contains arbirtrary hash
        All the data in the first block is hashed into a hash that is stored in the second block and then it keeps on goin

 
Explain how proof of work functions.
 How does it operate. 
    -- proof of work is code that is recorded in blocks that require a crap ton of computing power to generate. 

 How does this protect the chain from attack.
    --impossible to add valid block without valid proof of work
    manipulating the transactions gets messed up cause the next block is signed with a diff proof of work
 What kind of attack is possible?
    -- if one person controls more than half then they are able to control the decentralized network

## Project Set Up

#### [Hash Tables]

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through two algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the .py skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with make tests.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the hashtable.py file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

*You may not use any advanced, built-in Python functions to solve these problems.*

#### [Blockchain]

For the blockchain portion of the challenge, you will be writing code for a new miner that will solve a different Proof of Work algorithm than the one we have been working with.

Your goal is to mine at least one coin.  Keep in mind that with many people competing over the same coins, this may take a long time.  By our math, we expect that an average solution should be the first to find a solution at least once in an hour or two of mining.
